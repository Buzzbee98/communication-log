   <p>Radio check. Pilot, please confirm.</p>
   <p>Confirmation, Control. We're noobies with Terminal and git, so kinda slow on this end!</p>
   <p>I Think we finally have good signal! nice to hear back from you pilot.</p>
   <p>Right on, Control! Planning to land on my private island in the Bahamas.</p>
   <p>Keep us updated with your coordinates, we will be on our way shortly. Be ready with the pina coladas.</p>
